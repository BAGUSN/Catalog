And it turns out the funny Brit, 35, is in good company.  <br \/><br \/>Here are a few other stars who got their driver&#39;s licenses late in life &#8211; or simply don&#39;t drive at all: <br \/><br \/>&#149; Carey Mulligan, 25, never wanted to drive, but had to learn for her recent movie, <em>Never Let Me Go<\/em>. \"I always thought I&#39;d crash,\" Mulligan told PEOPLE at the Toronto International Film Festival. \"I worked with a driver during awards season and he used to give me lessons on the side so that&#39;s how I got it together.\"  <br \/><br \/>&#149; <a href=\"http:\/\/www.people.com\">Daniel Radcliffe,<\/a> 21, who just learned to drive last year, was so determined to get his license that he opted to take lessons in the quiet English countryside instead of the congested streets of London.  <br \/><br \/>&#149; Fellow Brit <a href=\"http:\/\/www.people.com\/people\/robert_pattinson\">Robert Pattinson<\/a> confessed he doesn&#39;t exactly know his way around a car to <a href=\"http:\/\/www.people.com\/people\/ellen_degeneres\">Ellen DeGeneres<\/a>. \"I don&#39;t actually know how to drive. It&#39;s absolutely terrifying,\" he told the talk show host while admitting he does drive himself around L.A. \"I don&#39;t know how to use the little wipey thing on the windscreen, so I couldn&#39;t see out of the windscreen.\"  <br \/><br \/>&#149; Earlier this year, singer <a href=\"http:\/\/www.people.com\/people\/amy_winehouse\">Amy Winehouse<\/a>, 27, declared that she <a href=\"http:\/\/www.contactmusic.com\/news.nsf\/story\/amy-winehouse-wants-driving-lessons_1136573\"  target=\"_blank\" >wanted driving lessons<\/a> on her Twitter account.     <br \/><br \/>&#149; <em>Mad Men<\/em> star Vincent Kartheiser, 31, takes two buses or the L.A. Metro to the set of his Emmy winning AMC show. \"Instead of driving and being stressed out about traffic, you can work your scene, you can do your exercises or whatever on the bus,\" Kartheiser told <a href=\"http:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2010\/10\/03\/fashion\/03With.html?_r=1\"  target=\"_blank\" ><em>The New York Times<\/em><\/a> recently.  <br \/><br \/>&#149; British comic Ricky Gervais, 49, needs to find new ways to spend his fortune since he doesn&#39;t have a license. \"I don&#39;t drive so I haven&#39;t bought a flash car,\" he has said.  <br \/><br \/><b>&#149; Reporting by MICHAEL GIOIA and LESLEY MESSER<\/b><br \/><br \/> ",

We enjoy a lot of the same things and we enjoy each other&#39;s company.\"<br \/><br \/>One of the things they share is a love of music, which comes in handy, since Lachey is not only a singer, but starting Dec. 6 he will be hosting NBC&#39;s <em>Sing Off<\/em> competition, too.  <br \/><br \/>\"&#91;Vanessa&#93; is an incredible host &#8211; that&#39;s what she&#39;s done for years &#8211; so I get a lot of advice from her,\" he says.  <br \/><br \/>In between episodes, the newly engaged couple will also head to Lachey&#39;s hometown of Cincinnati, where they will visit the Cincinnati Zoo and the Cincinnati Children&#39;s Hospital for philanthropic reasons. They&#39;ll also spend time with Lachey’s brother, Drew, and his wife and kids.   <br \/><br \/>\"It&#39;s great being an uncle,\" Lachey says. \"Vanessa and I try to spoil them every chance we get!\"  <br \/><br \/>Playing St. Nick to the little ones also has Lachey thinking about his own future &#8211; and how much he wants kids of his own.  <br \/><br \/>\"I&#39;m pushing 40 here, so the time is probably imminent,\" he says. \"Everything happens in the right time and for now, it&#39;s good training to be an uncle. Hopefully mine will turn out as good as &#91;Drew&#39;s&#93;!\"  <br \/><br \/>In the meantime, Lachey is excited to be engaged to the love of his life. \"She’s a great girl,\" he says. \"She&#39;s incredibly intelligent, incredibly personable. She&#39;s independent, yet supportive. I&#39;m extremely happy that she&#39;s mine.\"  <br \/><br \/><br \/><br \/>",
